            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Shane Ryan, and I'm a UL student from County Sligo. I chose my course because I have an interest in design and computing, and would hopefully work in either of those fields once I graduate. When I'm not working or studying, you can often find me drawing, as it's one of my favorite ways to relax and express creativity. I also enjoy going for runs, which helps me clear my mind and stay active.</p>
            <p>I also have a strong interest in global finance. I find the dynamics of global markets and economic systems fascinating, and I'm constantly learning more about the intricacies of finance and how it shapes the world we live in..</p>

            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                Looking  back I would think that this webpage is a simple and concise representation of myself. If I could expand the site I would probably add more CSS styles or implement some other features. If I gained more web development skills, I would add animations, interactive features, better mobile design, a way to store data, and improve how search engines find my site.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the near future, I aim to continue exploring the versatile uses of HTML and other web technologies, building on the knowledge I've gained to create impactful, user-centric designs. My ultimate goal is to work on dynamic and engaging digital campaigns that can influence and inspire.
